# Encom Smart Home Web App - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Encom is a smart home web application that will be served on an internal IP within a home network. The application will feature a widget-based dashboard where users can add and configure various widgets for different functionalities such as bin collection reminders, weather information, and plant watering reminders based on weather conditions.

## Current Status
The project has been initialized with Laravel, TypeScript, and Vue.js. The basic structure is in place, and widget templates have been created. The next steps involve integrating the widget templates into the main project and implementing the core widget system.
